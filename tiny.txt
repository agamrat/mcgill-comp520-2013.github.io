1. We will be using flex+bison for the WIG project.
2. It was time-consuming and frustrating to figure out how to use git and github.
Modifying the grammar was interesting and it was fun to watch the evaluator 
actually work at the end. 
3. It would have been fun to understand the tiny.l and tiny.y files better and
make more modifications to them. Maybe next year students could write more of
the grammar itself.
