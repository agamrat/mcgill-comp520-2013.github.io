We have to decide what types are allowed in Wig and the context in which a type makes sense or makes no sense. These things are universal in programming. Thus, we have to define type rules. Only after we have a good set of type rules, we can proceed to do the code generation part.
 
We have to allow the use of tuple. A tuple in Wig is similar to a struct in C. Using just simple data types significantly limits the power of the wig language. But then the type checker should be much more complex with tuples. It will not be easy to allow passing tuples as arguments in functions and returning tuples in functions.
 
CGI is stateless. No information remains on the server. But one main features of Wig is sessions, and different sessions can interact. The use of global variables in Wig allows interactions among sessions and different users. Sequences of sessions can be modeled to be interaction between clients and the server. The flow of control needs to be defined very clearly. A session can possible be stopped temporally and restarted later. CGI scripts usually do not allow these.
