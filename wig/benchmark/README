Hangman.wig can be found up and running at: cs.mcgill.ca/~agamra/hangman.pl?Guess.
It implements a simple hangman game, choosing between 5 possible words and allowing 5 wrong guesses. To use, enter the position of the letter and the letter itself into the form.
Although the guess box is all one line, each word can be assumed to be 4 letters long (as the position field is only valid for 1-4).
