In order to generate the CGI code for a WIG service, the compiler might 
first parse the syntax tree of the WIG service. Then it would fill in 
the gaps left by the <[ ]> tags. In addition to this it would need to 
add the <form> tag to the html code sending input so that the input
is sent to the CGI script through a post.
An extra complications for translating the WIG benchmark using the 
compiler may be figuring out what variables need to be saved in the 
session.
